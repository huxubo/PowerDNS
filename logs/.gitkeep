# This file ensures the logs directory is tracked by Git
# The directory is needed for API logging
#
# Permissions:
# - This directory should be writable by the web server user (www, www-data, nginx, etc.)
# - Run: chmod 755 logs && chown www:www logs (adjust user as needed)
#
# Log files will be created automatically when the API is running
